  abstract  = {Photogrammetry comprises techniques concerned with making measurements of real-world objects and terrain features from images. Applications include the measuring of coordinates, quantification of distances, heights, areas, and volumes, 3D topographic mapping, the extraction of 3D point clouds for surface reconstructions, and the generation of digital elevation models and orthophotographs. The most recent development of point-cloud generation techniques with Structure from Motion–Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) has led to significant advances in 3D geodata acquisition from SFAP and UAS imagery. This chapter reviews the basic principles of photogrammetry, beginning with the geometry of single photographs. It continues with the geometry of stereophotographs and principles of stereoscopic surveying. Characteristics are summarized for traditional and SfM-based photogrammetry approaches for reconstructing 3D coordinates from stereomodels and creating orthophotos. Sources of errors as well as SFAP-specific challenges are discussed.}

Therefore, fast and accurate image matching is very crucial for 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we proposed a Cascade Hashing strategy to speed up the image matching. In order to accelerate the image matching, the proposed Cascade Hashing method is designed to be three-layer structure: hashing lookup, hashing remapping, and hashing ranking. Each layer adopts different measures and filtering strategies, which is demonstrated to be less sensitive to noise. Extensive experiments show that image matching can be accelerated by our approach in hundreds times than brute force matching, even achieves ten times or more than Kd-tree based matching while retaining comparable accuracy.},

The problem is to find the possible solutions for relative camera pose between two calibrated views given five corresponding points. The algorithm consists of computing the coefficients of a tenth degree polynomial in closed form and, subsequently, finding its roots. It is the first algorithm well-suited for numerical implementation that also corresponds to the inherent complexity of the problem. We investigate the numerical precision of the algorithm. We also study its performance under noise in minimal as well as overdetermined cases. The performance is compared to that of the well-known 8 and 7-point methods and a 6-point scheme. The algorithm is used in a robust hypothesize-and-test framework to estimate structure and motion in real-time with low delay. The real-time system uses solely visual input and has been demonstrated at major conferences.},

These objectives lead to the proposed semi-global matching method that performs pixelwise matching based on mutual information and the approximation of a global smoothness constraint. Occlusions are detected and disparities determined with sub-pixel accuracy. Additionally, an extension for multi-baseline stereo images is presented. There are two novel contributions. Firstly, a hierarchical calculation of mutual information based matching is shown, which is almost as fast as intensity based matching. Secondly, an approximation of a global cost calculation is proposed that can be performed in a time that is linear to the number of pixels and disparities. The implementation requires just 1 second on typical images.},

Depth and visibility are jointly modelled as a hiddenMarkov Random Field, and the spatial correlations of both are explicitly accounted for. Inference is made tractable by an EM-algorithm, which alternates between estimation of visibility and depth, and optimisation of model parameters. We describe and compare two implementations of the E-step of the algorithm, which correspond to the Mean Field and Bethe approximations of the free energy. The approach is validated by experiments on challenging real-world scenes, of which two are contaminated by independently moving objects.},

Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different variants. In order to establish a common software platform and a collection of data sets for easy evaluation, we have designed a stand-alone, flexible C++ implementation that enables the evaluation of individual components and that can be easily extended to include new algorithms. We have also produced several new multiframe stereo data sets with ground truth, and are making both the code and data sets available on the Web.},

Surfaces which do not have direct support in the input 3D point cloud and hence need not be photo-consistent but represent real parts of the scene (e.g. low-textured walls, windows, cars) are important for achieving complete reconstructions. We augmented the existing Labatut CGF 2009 method with the ability to cope with these difficult surfaces just by changing the t-edge weights in the construction of surfaces by a minimal s-t cut. Our method uses Visual-Hull to reconstruct the difficult surfaces which are not sampled densely enough by the input 3D point cloud. We demonstrate importance of these surfaces on several real-world data sets. We compare our improvement to our implementation of the Labatut CGF 2009 method and show that our method can considerably better reconstruct difficult surfaces while preserving thin structures and details in the same quality and computational time.},

  abstract = {Modern design process is a complex work which includes many aspects and so CAD/CAM/CAE are widely used now. The next special generation of such software which combines complex geometrical design facilities, micro-models of composite structures and FE analysis, and tools for additive technologies has to be developed. This paper proposes a design methodology of a new 3D raster/vector drawing program to make micro-models with crowding or coarsening of fiber structures. The definitions of the new terms, principles, and algorithms to design such structure as a set of domains are given. Files for additive technology machines and finite element analysis were created. This approach is the convenient means of micro-modeling of FRC complex shape parts.}

  abstract  = {The methods for visual learning that compute a space of eigenvectors by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) traditionally require a batch computation step. Since this leads to potential problems when dealing with large sets of images, several incremental methods for the computation of the eigenvectors have been introduced. However such learning cannot be considered as an on-line process, since all the images are retained until the final step of computation of space of eigenvectors, when their coefficients in this subspace are computed. In this paper we propose a method that allows for simultaneous learning and recognition. We show that we can keep only the coefficients of the learned images and discard the actual images and still are able to build a model of appearance that is fast to compute and open-ended. We performed extensive experimental testing which showed that the recognition rate and reconstruction accuracy are comparable to those obtained by the batch method.},

  abstract  = {We show that surface reconstruction from oriented points can be cast as a spatial Poisson problem. This Poisson formulation considers all the points at once, without resorting to heuristic spatial partitioning or blending, and is therefore highly resilient to data noise. Unlike radial basis function schemes, our Poisson approach allows a hierarchy of locally supported basis functions, and therefore the solution reduces to a well conditioned sparse linear system. We describe a spatially adaptive multiscale algorithm whose time and space complexities are proportional to the size of the reconstructed model. Experimenting with publicly available scan data, we demonstrate reconstruction of surfaces with greater detail than previously achievable.},
