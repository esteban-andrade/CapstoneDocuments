abstract = {Photogrammetry comprises techniques concerned with making measurements of real-world objects and terrain features from images. Applications include the measuring of coordinates, quantification of distances, heights, areas, and volumes, 3D topographic mapping, the extraction of 3D point clouds for surface reconstructions, and the generation of digital elevation models and orthophotographs. The most recent development of point-cloud generation techniques with Structure from Motion–Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) has led to significant advances in 3D geodata acquisition from SFAP and UAS imagery. This chapter reviews the basic principles of photogrammetry, beginning with the geometry of single photographs. It continues with the geometry of stereophotographs and principles of stereoscopic surveying. Characteristics are summarized for traditional and SfM-based photogrammetry approaches for reconstructing 3D coordinates from stereomodels and creating orthophotos. Sources of errors as well as SFAP-specific challenges are discussed.}
